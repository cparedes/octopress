On the 27th of February, I start at Amazon as a systems engineer in the AWS
Cloudfront team.

I can't even say how excited I am - I've been wanting to be at Amazon for the
longest time now, and I finally did it. I'm at fucking Amazon, working with
a large installation that has way more machines than I could even fathom.

I'll continue to blog here, but when it comes to work related things, I'll
have to keep a tight lip. Sorry folks. I'm not sure what this means exactly
in terms of the kinds of posts I've made so far (mostly reviews and quick
guides of various software), but I'd imagine those types of posts will
likely be a lot less frequent. What I would *like* to do instead, is talk
about other things that I might be doing on my off time - this means
board games, other OSS software that I'm working on, music, and movies.

Anyway, this doesn't mean the death of this blog - I hope this actually
spurs more discussion on a wider variety of things.

Cheers, gl, hf, etc. etc.
