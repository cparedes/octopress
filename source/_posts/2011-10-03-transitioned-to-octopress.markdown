So, I've transitioned from [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) to
[Octopress](http://octopress.org).  It comes with a really nice default HTML5
template that I've edited a bit (changed some fonts, colors, etc.), and has a
decent fallback for mobile devices, all of which was lacking in my last site
design with Jekyll (if anyone's interested, the [old site](https://github.com/cparedes/redbluemagenta-new) is still on my GitHub account.)

What's awesome about Octopress, anyway?

* It comes with a nice set of Rake tasks for handling common tasks, such as generating a new site and rsync'ing the pages over to a server. Also comes with Rake tasks for creating new posts and pages.
* The repository is very well laid out, with nice separation between themes and content.
* The default theme comes with scss files, which is way better to deal with than regular old css.
* Comes with a sane set of plugins that make things look awesome, such as code snippets, image embedding, and HTML5 video embedding (with Flash video fallback.)

Anyway, the site looks way better now that it's on Octopress, and it's a bit
easier to maintain as well.
