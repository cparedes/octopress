I just wanted to write a new blog post about all the folks who have helped me,
mentored me, and otherwise gave a ton of support during the past few years
of my career. I'm incredibly thankful for everyone's support over the years,
and I can't have made it to this point without you guys. Thanks.

If I forgot you, let me know.

* John Keithly: for your technical support class in Ballard High School.
You've taught all of us a ton of knowledge on how computers worked, how
to troubleshoot these infernal machines, and for allowing us to break and
fix Linux and Windows machines.
* Richard Green: for taking the chance on having me administer a few of your
UNIX boxes at the UW. It was my first real job where I had to do that, and
I learned a ton from you about UNIX, scripting, and making sure shit doesn't
go up in flames.
* Hoang Ngo: for your sage advice on surviving in the computing industry,
for your knowledge on networking, and for being an overall awesome, humble
guy to work with. Your dedication to the craft is pretty damn amazing,
and I'm incredibly humbled by your huge swath of knowledge.
* Michael Fox: for being one of the most awesome bosses ever, for shielding
our team from politics, keeping us sane during those intense days of setting
up old machines for the school, and for helping us climb out of the hole we
were in.
* Stephen Balukoff: though we squared off quite a bit during my tenure, you
were probably the most knowledgeable person in UNIX that I've ever known,
and you understood lots of the things I was going through at the time.
I'm also incredibly humbled by the knowledge you had of databases, UNIX, and
all things systems administration.
* Benjamin Krueger: you have and always had been an awesome mentor - you've
helped me a lot in my career, taught me a lot about systems administration,
and showed me the awesomeness of configuration management.
* Lee Damon: for also being an awesome mentor - you've seen a lot of what
the tech industry has to offer, and you've definitely gave me a lot of advice
on my career as I've advanced from a junior systems administrator to more of
a mid-level systems administrator. Thanks so much.
* Mike Sawicki: though we haven't really worked together much, your insight
and advice have helped me a lot. You've also provided a ton of awesome career
advice and have shown me a lot of awesome shit in the industry, too.

Again, let me know if I've missed anyone. (If you're not listed, it doesn't
mean I don't appreciate you - I certainly do! I've been blessed with knowing
so many awesome and knowledgeable folks in my short career - everyone's been
awesome, and I can't thank everyone enough for everything up to this point.)
