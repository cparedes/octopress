About the blog
--------------

This is my personal technical blog.  I write about systems administration, as
well as other things of interest, such as programming, music, and general
advocacy for various technology related issues.

This blog is hosted on a [prgmr](http://prgmr.com) VPS, running Debian Squeeze.
This website is available on both IPv4 and IPv6.

I also manage this server with [Chef](http://opscode.com), which is pretty
fantastic.

*(Some of you may ask, why not use something like GitHub pages to host your
website, instead of paying prgmr X amount of dollars per month?  It's mostly
because I want to have control over my own server - occasionally, I'll host
other things like game servers off of this VPS, which is something you can't do
with GitHub pages.  Plus, Luke Crawford is the shit.)*

About me
--------

{% img left /images/ian.jpg This is Ian %}

I'm a systems engineer for the [AWS Management Console Core](http://aws.amazon.com).

My language of choice is Ruby, though I can write Python and debug Java
programs in a pinch.

I started in systems administration not too long ago, though I've been running
Linux servers in my house since about 12 or so years ago.  I fell in love with
the UNIX way and open source software, which landed me square in UNIX systems
administration.

In my off time, I play a few computer games (Civilization, Battlefield, Total
War), and I also program and contribute to a few open source projects (though
they're usually small patches as well as bug reports - I do what I can.) I read
a lot of technical articles to keep myself up to date on what's going on in the
community, as well as keeping myself fresh with papers on distributed
computing.
